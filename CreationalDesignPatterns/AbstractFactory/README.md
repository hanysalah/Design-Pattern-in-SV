# Abstract Factory

It is to create a structure of classes (environment, agent .. etc) without any prior knowledge about its entire structure.

## Application

1. This pattern could be very useful in DV where multiple interfaces could be exist interchangeably.
2. It is a dynamic way of configure DV environment rather than using MACROs which makes the debugging very harsh.
