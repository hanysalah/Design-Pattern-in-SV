# Strategy Design Pattern

Strategy design pattern is a behavioral description pattern which enables TE to change the strategy *algorithm* it uses to process an object or a set of objects.
The basic idea is to create a single class per strategy to be extended from a single common parent class. Switching the parent handle between multiple strategy objects could be dynamically done.

# Application

- Strategy pattern could be used where complex algorithms like CRC and error data correction is carried out on a payload.
